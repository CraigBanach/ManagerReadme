# Manager's Readme

## Introduction

My goal is to put into the open all the thoughts I have, or the questions you might think about. I want you to have a view into my mind, so there is no confusion as to what I expect. I hope it will make your lives a bit easier ðŸ™‚

## My role

I believe my role within the business is to make sure that our team works well. To that end, there are two things that I spend a lot of time doing:

- Helping the team grow & thrive
  - Listening during refinements & putting solutions in place off the back of it
  - Regular 1:1s to understand how everyone is getting on and where they want their career to go
  - Unblocking my team regularly by understanding the problems we face & finding the correct person or process to follow to make progress
- Delivering our work on time (and to a high quality)
  - Asking probing questions during handover & refinement sessions to elicit technical detail about what we are looking to build
  - Ensuring everyone on the team understands what we are trying to achieve
  - Estimating our work
  - Planning our work based upon previous sprints' velocities

## 1:1s

Typically we will have 1:1s for 45 minutes every 2 weeks, but ultimately we should schedule these in for an appropriate frequency & duration that works for us. It may be beneficial to have more frequent or less frequent 1:1s based upon how you like to work & how we work together.

If you ever have anything that you want to discuss with me, you don't have to wait until your 1:1 to discuss it with me. If you like, feel free to put some time in my calendar or if I'm booked out, reach out to me directly to let me know you want to chat about something & I'll make time for you.

### 1:1 Content

1:1s tend to work best when we both come to the meeting with an agenda in mind. I would love it if you take some notes since our last meeting & come with a list of things to discuss, but I appreciate that sometimes you may not have anything.

With my own manager, I frequently have a list of topics to discuss with them. I will explain what is going on with the team & try to make my manager understand how to help the team thrive by pointing them in the direction of things they can improve/fix for us. Please do treat our 1:1 in the same way.

Generally during our 1:1 meetings I will try to cover the following topics:

- Catch up no a personal level
- Understand how you've been getting on at work
  - Including any successes/achievements
  - Including any mistakes/things that could have gone better
- Align on your path forward (by giving feedback, discussing problems, or sharing my thoughts)
